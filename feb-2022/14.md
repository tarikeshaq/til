# Monday, February 14th
Huh the day is ending and I had to think **really** hard about what I learned today, but hey it's Monday ðŸ¤·

## Sometimes the data you **don't** see is more important than the data you see
I was looking at some of the dashboards we have at work to identify any non-usual behavior - it all looked perfectly fine!

Until, I decided to look deeper into a couple of the charts, the time period there is 30 days, so I thought what happens if I see a longer trend, lets say 120 days. and AHA! there was an upward trend for read errors on one of our components that started in November. The rate is low, but it is something we have to tackle an fix.

On the flip side of that, I did the same for a few other charts and I noticed that a different component we have, had its write errors shrink by a large magnitude, and it aligned perfectly with some bug fixes we shipped ðŸ˜„

## If it's not on file, no one will do it
That is not quite true, a lot of stuff gets done that never finds its way to a ticket - however, if something **does** find its way to a ticket and get assigned a high priority, it will get done. I found the highest ranked error in Sentry, and I realized that we've known about this for a very long time, but we haven't taken actions on it yet... At first, we wanted to see how often it happens, but now the error is just there ðŸ¤·


I think I'll wrap at that today, this was a good reflection exercise - because all the above is from work, and that tells me something...
